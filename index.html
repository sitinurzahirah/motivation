<br>
<p> <font style="font-size: 20px;"> When you study at home, you need to create or having a study space where you can study and learning properly and give full attention on it. The study space must be in suitable place like in your room or library room in your house as it not disturb you while doing the works or online classes. Organize your study space to give a lift up your motivate by keep the important things only on the study space when learning on the table such as <mark>arrange your text book properly, keep the subject's notes in file and also if you need a chair make sure to have a comfortable one as you may spend a lot of time at study space. </mark>   Study space can make you more focus, ready and consistent in online education and away from distractions. </font> </p>

<br>
<p> <font style="font-size: 20px;"> Study online can be isolating. This sometime make you feel left out in study when you not understand the task or not feel 100 percent of things all of time and you it's better to study with 2 people than alone. This is important to ask around when you are in doubt as if someone is master on that. We still can do discussion or study group even not in meeting face to face but we can video call to have discussion on something that bothering you in study and also help each other out with homework and assignment just don't copy each other. This will be help us in surviving in online education alone.

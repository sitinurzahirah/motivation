<center> <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"> 1. CREATE A REMINDER </h2>
<br>

<br>
<center> <p> <font style="font-size: 22px;"> First of all, create a reminder about your task, assignment, deadlines, exam and all important work that required to you. The important thing is your timetable for the whole semester, print out or create because it will be make you on alert when see the timetable. Put all the reminder on the notice board or use whatever that works on and also make sure that it can reach and see clearly. 
<p> This way will have a clear view of the month ahead. For sure this can make our schedule stay organized and if the plans change we can rearranging it to keep alert and it much easier and less stressful because of the reminder. </font> </p> </center>

<br>

<br>
<center> <p> <font style="font-size: 22px;"> When you study at home, you need to create or having a study space where you can study and learning properly and give full attention on it. The study space must be in suitable place like in your room or library room in your house as it not disturb you while doing the works or online classes. 
<p> Organize your study space to give a lift up your motivate by keep the important things only on the study space when learning on the table such as <mark> arrange your text book properly, keep the subject's notes in file and also if you need a chair make sure to have a comfortable one as you may spend a lot of time at study space. </mark> Study space can make you more focus, ready and consistent in online education and away from distractions. </font> </p> <center>

<center> <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"> 3. KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FRIENDS </h2> 
<br>
<img src="image/friends.jpg" height="300px"> </center>
<br>
<center> <p> <font style="font-size: 22px;"> Study online can be isolating. This sometime make you feel left out in study when you not understand the task or not feel 100 percent of things all of time and you it's better to study with 2 people than alone. This is important to ask around when you are in doubt as if someone is master on that. We still can do discussion or study group even not in meeting face to face but we can video call to have discussion on something that you not understand in study and also help each other out with homework and assignment just don't copy each other. This will be help us in surviving in online education alone. </p>

<center> <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"> 4. TAKE A BREAK </h2>
<br>

<br>
<center> <p> <font style="font-size: 22px;"> Take a break are also important part of successful work ethic. Been study for long time without taking a break can made your mind exhausted, feel tension and stress. Our brain also need to rest. If you spend every minutes of everyday by doing task within the same position, spend more time infront your laptop make you feel more tired, you will drive yourself crazy. By that take a break if you feel tired or stress while online study.
<p> Take a step back. Rest for a while from doing your task by doing such as take a nap, play your favourite game, sipping some coffee and others. Move around for awhile is better and can boost your energy. After that come back from a break and continue where you left the task. </font> </p> </center>

<center> <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"> 5. MAKE IT AS USUAL ROUTINE </h2>
<br>

<br>
<center> <p> <font style="font-size: 22px;"> You probably have more flexible time than ever, but that also means you have to keep choosing participating in online education as being schedule. Get back your routine when having physical class as usual as this can make us feel more attached and participating into the online education. The routine like wake up early and start early. Treat your new day as though always before you are going to the physical class, meaning shower, get dressed and get ready to receive a lecture. 
<p> If you are get back in your routine, it wil give us more easy to stay motivate, participated in online education although it a little bit struggle at first because we are distance learning and the environment quite different. </font> </p> </center>
